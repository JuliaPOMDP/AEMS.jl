Implements anytime error minimization search (AEMS) solver for POMDPs.

# Installation


# Quick Use

```julia
solver = AEMSSolver()
```

# Solver Options

* `n_iterations` Maximum number of fringe expansions during one action. Defaults to 1000.
* `max_time` Maximum time (in seconds) to spend on one action. Defaults to 1 second.
* `updater` The updater used to propagate beliefs in the tree. Defaults to a discrete updater.
* `lower_bound` Defaults to a fixed-action policy.
* `upper_bound` Defaults to a policy generated by FIB.
* `root_manager` Determines how the root changes once an action is taken and an observation is received. Allowed values are `:clear`, `:belief`, `:user`. Defaults to `:clear`.

# Visualization

```julia
# suppose you have a planner and have called action (to generate a tree)

using D3Trees

tree = D3Tree(planner)      # creates a visualization tree
inchrome(tree)              # opens chrome tab to show visualization tree
```
